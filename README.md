# student_task_repo_1
Something for students to clone, to get familiar with git.

To clone this repository, you're going to want to try the following inside your terminal on Cloud9:
```
git clone https://github.com/roy-keyin/student_task_repo_1.git
```

After that, you can try running the two examples in there. To run the shell script, try:
```
chmod +x example.sh
./example.sh
```

You can also run my example fizzbuzz program from the command line by using:
```
python3 fizzbuzz.py
```

Give that a try now.

Please also open the code in the editor and take a look at the source code.
Feel free to make any changes that you'd like.
